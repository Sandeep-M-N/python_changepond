->map,filter and reduce are paradigms of functional programming
-> map and filter come built in with python(built in functions)
-> reduce, needs to be imported as it resides in functional tools



->syntax
filter(function,iterable)
->function : it tests if each element of a sequenece True or not
->sequenece : which needs to be filtered, it can be list,sets,tuples or containers of any
iterators


->lambda function(also known as Anonymous function) - > function without a name
->this function can take any number of arguemnts bu only one expression,which is evaluated and returned

Syntax: lambda arguemnts: expression

map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results
after applying the given functon to each item of a given iterable(list,tuple etc)
or allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable without using an explicit for loop, a technique commonly known as  mapping

syntax:
map(function,iterable,[iterable1,iterable2....])
