-> our program around functions i.e blocks of statements that manipulate data.This is called the procedural-oriented way of programming

-> There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionaity and wrap it inside something called an object. this is called as object-oriented programming

OOP's concepts:
-> class
-> objects
-> polymorphism
-> Encapsulation
-> inhewritance
-> Data abstraction

Class:
-> class is a collection of objects
-> a class is a blueprint for how something should be defined.
-> classes define the functions called methods,which identify the behaviours that an object created from the class can perform its data

Objects:
-> objects are anything that has properties and some behaviours
->properties of objects-> variables 
-> behaviours -> functions of the objects
-> the properties that all objects have are defined in a method called __init__()

-> __init__ sets the inital stage of the object

property function:
-> property() method is a built-in function
-> allows us to create a special type of attribute called a property for a class
-> to manage attribute access, Encapsulation and validation within a class
-> the property() function can be used instead of the 
@property deocorator to achieve same functionaity

# syntax
property(fget=None,fset=None,fdel=None,doc=None)
fget-> function to get the value
fset -> function to set the value
fdel -> function to delete the attribute
doc -> string that serves as the documentries for the attribute
