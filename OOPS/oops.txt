-> our program around functions i.e blocks of statements that manipulate data.This is called the procedural-oriented way of programming

-> There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionaity and wrap it inside something called an object. this is called as object-oriented programming

OOP's concepts:
-> class
-> objects
-> polymorphism
-> Encapsulation
-> inhewritance
-> Data abstraction

Class:
-> class is a collection of objects
-> a class is a blueprint for how something should be defined.
-> classes define the functions called methods,which identify the behaviours that an object created from the class can perform its data

Objects:
-> objects are anything that has properties and some behaviours
->properties of objects-> variables 
-> behaviours -> functions of the objects
-> the properties that all objects have are defined in a method called __init__()

-> __init__ sets the inital stage of the object
